# Digikala Academy comment verification contest

### Problem
Digikala, Iran's largest online store, allows users to purchase and review a diverse range of products. In this store, the user can comment on the products he has bought or has information about them, and others can use the user experience. In the meantime, there may be comments that are inappropriate for being published and should be filtered. In this problem, you have to predict the rejection or approval of comments in Digikala by machine learning algorithms.

I won the first place in this contest with 84.1 f1 score. ([link to scoreboard](https://quera.ir/contest/assignments/10668/scoreboard/))
